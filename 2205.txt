LOCAL REPO INIT
- after cloning
- open terminal or integrated terminal of project
- npm i for root (possibilitea folder)
- php artisan migrate (when DB structure is actually setup, for now ignore)
- npm i for vue folder
- npm run tailbuild (vue folder)

BASIC COMMANDS
- during each and every development session, execute these commands:
    FRONTEND:
    npm run dev (1 terminal) -> launch a local dev server
    npm run tailwatch (1 terminal) -> watch css for changes; instant compilation and build
    
    BACKEND:
    php artisan serve
    php artisan migrate (when there are DB changes from other branches/incoming changes)

THINGS TO NOTE
- When using a Fontawesome Icon and its not yet registered in the library, make sure to:
    1. Open icons.js
    2. Import specific icon from @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons module
        2.1. Refer to Fontawesome website for name of icon
            2.1.1. Ex: class="fa-solid fa-xmark" ||| import { faXmark } from "@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons"
    3. Add them to library
        3.1. add() method of library accepts an array of strings (names of icons), just add the name of your icon
            3.1.1 Ex: library.add(['xmark', 'minus',]);
    4. Use it inside your Vue file.
        4.1. <font-awesome-icon icon="xmark">
            4.1.1 Refer to fontawesome docs for more props such as size, etc. 
- When using our project-specific color schemes and font sizes, refer to:
    1. Figma for what to use
    2. tailwind.config.js for the actual name of the custom extended properties
    3. Use it inside your Vue file
        3.1. Ex: <p class="text-textInput bg-primary hover:bg-primaryHovered"
- When using postcss keywords, make sure to:
    1. set language to "postcss" in style
        1.1. Ex: <style lang="postcss" scoped>.testClass { @apply bg-primary hover:bg-primaryHovered } </style>
- Highly recommend sarah.drasner's Vue VSCode Snippets for easy set up of Vue file
- Highly recommend Vetur, Tailwind CSS Intellisense, vue (jcbuisson)

PROGRESS SO FAR
- Login, Navigation, and Partial POS
- Excel spreadsheet to track progress
